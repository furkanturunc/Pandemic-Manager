## Description:

This is a mobile application that enables instructors to track sudents' COVID risk statues.
It has 2 types of users: Instructor and student. Sudents can add their test results and upload their vaccine cards. If one is not vaccinated, the app will be sending him/her notifications regularly to remind their test schedule. There will be a seating plan for each class. The students will enter his/her seat number in a seating plan for each class so that he/she will stay in the same seat during the term. 

Instructors can see students who are not allowed on campus and receive notification if one of them enters the class. Using the feature of GPS, instructors can track COVID positive and not tested students. 

Instructors can also take attendance with a code given by the app. Students will enter the code. In this way, attendance will be taken easyl and without contact. 

If the instructor is in quarantine, all students will be notified.
